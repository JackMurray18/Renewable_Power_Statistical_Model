```

```{r}
folders <- list.files("C:/Users/jackm/Desktop/Data Science/Project/Renewable_Power_Statistical_Model/SOLAR_DATA")

#IMPORTANT
  * when extracting zip files of solar data - the csv files are in a folder that is nested in a folder
  * BOTH folders have the same name
```{r}
for (i in 24:length((folders)))
{
    folder_locations <- paste0("C:/Users/jackm/Desktop/Data Science/Project/Renewable_Power_Statistical_Model/SOLAR_DATA/",folders[i],"/",folders[i])
  
    data <- Solar_Data(folder_locations)
    
    write.csv(data, file = paste0("1998-2020 solar data","_location_",i))
}
